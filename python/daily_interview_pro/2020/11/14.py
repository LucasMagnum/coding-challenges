Kaprekar's Constant

This problem was recently asked by Facebook:

Kaprekar's Constant is the number 6174.
This number is special because it has the property where for any 4-digit number t
hat has 2 or more unique digits, if you repeatedly apply a certain function it always
reaches the number 6174.

This certain function is as follows:
- Order the number in ascending form and descending form to create 2 numbers.
- Pad the descending number with zeros until it is 4 digits in length.
- Subtract the ascending number from the descending number.
- Repeat.

Given a number n, find the number of times the function needs to be applied to reach Kaprekar's constant. Here's some starter code:

"""


KAPREKAR_CONSTANT = 6174


def num_kaprekar_iterations(n):
    if n == KAPREKAR_CONSTANT:
        return 0

    n_str = str(n)
    asc_num = int("".join(sorted(n_str)))
    desc_num =  int("".join(sorted(n_str.zfill(4), reverse=True)))

    new_num = desc_num - asc_num
    return num_kaprekar_iterations(new_num) + 1


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(num_kaprekar_iterations(123))
    # 3
    # Explanation:
    #  3210 - 123 = 3087
    #  8730 - 0378 = 8352
    #  8532 - 2358 = 6174 (3 iterations)
