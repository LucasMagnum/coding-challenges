Pascal's Triangle

This problem was recently asked by AirBNB:

Pascal's Triangle is a triangle where all numbers are the sum of the two numbers above it.

Here's an example of the Pascal's Triangle of size 5.
    1
   1 1
  1 2 1
 1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1
Given an integer n, generate the n-th row of the Pascal's Triangle.

def pascal_triangle_row(n):
    row = [1] * n

    for i in range(n):
        last = row[0]

        for j in range(1, i):
            row[j], last = last + row[j], row[j]

    return row

    print(pascal_triangle_row(6))
